# FigJam Widgets for Mausritter

I recently discovered mauritter and thought that figma's whiteboarding app would be a good place to run an adventure. Little did I know that figma's editing surface is terrible for structured notetaking/tracking like you would find in ttrpgs. This was especially bad because of the tactile item system in mausritter. I wanted a cleaner experience for me and my friends, so I threw together these widgets to make playing mausritter just a little bit easier for anyone!
